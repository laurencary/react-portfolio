            <p>Having worked as an Actuary and Data Analyst for the first eight years of my career, 
                I have a solid foundation in math, statistics, and working with large, complicated
                datasets. During that time, I built a lot of internal tools for myself, coworkers,
                and even directors, using Python, SQL, and even Visual Basic (should I even admit that?).  
                I loved the puzzle of understanding the workflows, integrating all the components, 
                systematically connecting them for a seamless experience, and making it look good along 
                the way. Multiple times I was recognized for my impact, from receiving employee of the 
                month, to one of my coworkers telling me he wanted me to build all of the tools the 
                actuaries used. I knew I wanted to become a software engineer because of how exhilarating 
                the whole process was for me.


                <br /><br />
                Some of my favorite tools and languages include React, Redux,
                Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, SQL, and Python. I'm currently looking for a job where
                I can make an impact, continue learning and refining my skills, and work alongside passionate and motivated people.
