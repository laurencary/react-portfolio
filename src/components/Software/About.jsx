            <p>The first time I was described as a go getter, I was shocked.
                But that was because I was thinking of the type of person who
                has the ambition of gaining influence and prestige. For me,
                my drive comes from curiousity, determination, and the joy of learning. I aim
                to understand, reflect, refine and master.
                <br /><br />
                I started my career as an actuary. My passion to build tools,
                and automate workflows for myself and teammates made me realize
                that what I really wanted to be doing was developing software.
                Throughout my time as an actuary and data analyst, I used SQL
                and python daily. Knowing how important having a solid conception foundation
                for computer science would be, I enrolled in App Academy.

                <br /><br />
                Now, I'm so excited to call myself a software engineer. Some of my favorite tools and languages include React, Redux,
                Ruby on Rails, SQL, and Python. I'm currently looking for a job where I can make an impact, continue learning and
                refining my skills, and work alongside passionate and motivated people.
