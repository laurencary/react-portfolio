            <p>I learned woodworking from my husband, Austin and his father, John.
                It was a great way for us to connect, and learn how to communicate 
                and work together early on. We built most of the large furniture 
                together - except for the bench, which is one of my favorite pieces. 
                
                It's been a great outlet for me to explore my creativity. I love being able 
                to look around our home and see so much of it that we built. I'm someone who, 
                when inspired, can quickly see how things should 
                come together - and will be determined to see it come to fruition.
